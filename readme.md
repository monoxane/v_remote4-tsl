# V_Remote4 TSL

A microservice to take TSL tally and shove it into a Lawo V_Remote4 via Ember+ to update the MultiView overlays.

This will also do the reverse at some point in the future and take an input source ID and update a TSL address with that information (to sync a VMU Input Mnemonic with the recieving channel for example).
